Notes from CVC (www.cvcblr.com) on how to run the Ref kit on different tools
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. cd run_dir
2. make vcs --> Runs in VCS (2012.09)
   make cdn --> Runs in IUS (12.2)
   make qsta --> Questa (10.2)

Will add other tools as we get updates

Also some more code clean up is in pipeline, so stay tuned, check with info@cvcblr.com if interested
